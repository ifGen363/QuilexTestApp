Quilex Test App

Task:
GIF Searcher

Using the Giphy API, create an app to be able to search for GIFs.
Requirements

    GIFs must animate.

    The main view should:
        Show a list of Trending GIFs.
        Show a search bar so a user can find a GIF.

    After the user searches for a term, app will display results of search right there in the main view.

    You can use HTTP libraries like Retrofit/OKHttp, NSURLSession/AlamoFire, but not API clients like GiphyAndroidApi or Giphy-iOS.
    Caution: Giphy API may send down height and width properties as a String instead of a float.
    You may use 3rd party dependencies through CocoaPods, Carthage, and Gradle in helping you build your app. If you use CocoaPods or Gradle, please don't commit 3rd party source code.

Your solution should include a README explaining how to set up and run the project.
Bonus points for a nice and interesting UI.
Please use MVVM, and functional programming techniques where possible. Some libraries we enjoy are RxSwift, RxJava, and ReactiveCocoa.
The following languages are acceptable: Swift, Java, and Kotlin.


Checkout project in Android Studio and run gradle build.
